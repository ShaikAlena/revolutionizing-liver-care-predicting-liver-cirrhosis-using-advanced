Revolutionary Liver Cancer Prediction System:
This project presents an intelligent and efficient machine learning-based tool to assist in the early prediction of liver cancer using clinical and biochemical data. It aims to support healthcare professionals in identifying liver cancer risks more accurately and at an earlier stage, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

Overview:
Liver cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is critical but often challenging due to the subtlety of initial symptoms. This system addresses the problem by analyzing key patient features and predicting the likelihood of liver cancer using advanced ML models.

Key Features:
Predicts liver cancer risk using supervised ML models

Data preprocessing, handling of missing values, and normalization

Visual analysis of key health indicators

Comparison of model performance (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Deployed using a Flask-based web interface
